# SIRgame
Classroom game to minimize outbreak cost with an SIR model

Uses an SIRV format with a tau-leap implementation. 
Output is the cost of the outbreak. 
Choices are vaccinations per day (v), "quarantine" (q) to cut the contacts per person per day, and "surveillance" (s) to cut the duration of infectiousness

The model runs for 50 days with 100 iterations.

All variables are modifiable.
